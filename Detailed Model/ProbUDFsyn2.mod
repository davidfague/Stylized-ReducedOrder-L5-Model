TITLE AMPA and NMDA receptor with presynaptic short-term plasticity 


COMMENT
AMPA and NMDA receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
presynaptic short-term plasticity based on Fuhrmann et al. 2002
Implemented by Srikanth Ramaswamy, Blue Brain Project, July 2009
Etay: changed weight to be equal for NMDA and AMPA, gmax accessible in Neuron

PARAMETER {

        tau_r = 0.2   (ms)  : dual-exponential conductance profile
        tau_d = 1.7    (ms)  : IMPORTANT: tau_r < tau_d
        Use = 1.0   (1)   : Utilization of synaptic efficacy (just initial values! Use, Dep and Fac are overwritten by BlueBuilder assigned values) 
        Dep = 100   (ms)  : relaxation time constant from depression
        Fac = 10   (ms)  :  relaxation time constant from facilitation
        e = 0     (mV)  : AMPA and NMDA reversal potential
    	gmax = .001 (uS) : weight conversion factor (from nS to uS)
    	u0 = 0 :initial value of u, which is the running value of Use
}

COMMENT
The Verbatim block is needed to generate random nos. from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 
for comparison with Pr to decide whether to activate the synapse or not
