microcircuit.hoc:
Parallel simulation of microcircuit of L5 thick tufted pyramidal cells
(TTCs).

Parameters for the user to play with:
1. Nmc = number of cells in the microcircuits
2. connectivity = 0 or 1, whether the cells are interconnected or not
3. modelnum = 1 to 6, referring to the different biophysical models
4. condition = simulation condition, see comments in file for options

Changelog
