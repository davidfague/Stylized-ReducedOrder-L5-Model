# L5 Morphology
id,type,x,y,z,rad,pid

Types:
	Soma = 0
	Basal Dendrite = 3
	Oblique = 4
	Trunk = 5
	Tuft = 10

#notes
	Need 'Individual Paths' folders	and Trunk.swc to run L5_Morphology_Calculations

	Folders: Dendrites manually separated into individual pathway profiles from primary branching point to every 		terminal end using NeuTube.
	L5_Morphology_Calculations: Compute mean length of dendrite and radii for specified sectioning. May consider 		standard deviation.
