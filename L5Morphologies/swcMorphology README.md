# L5 Morphology

Types:
	Soma = 0
	Basal Dendrite = 3
	Oblique = 4
	Trunk = 5
	Tuft = 10

# Goal
	Currently sectioning dendrites into individual pathway profiles through each branch.	

	Determine the path length from single primary branching point to every terminal point, determining mean and standard deviation path length of dendrite. Also some principled approach for gather mean and std for radii.

NeuTube can be used for this purpose.
