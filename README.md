# Stylized Reduced-Order L5 Model

Synaptic input:
	Find an in vivo model, preferably based on Hay et. al., that has synaptic input.

Electrotonic Distance:
	Update to show mutliple frequencies: Baseline 1-5 hz, Beta rhythmic inhibition, Gamma rhythmic inhibition.

Nexus Axial Current:
	Record axial resistance between the nexus and adjacemt compartments, and use recorded membrane voltage to calculate axial current.

Consider the Principled Morphology notebooks

Other models:
	Sodium learning
