# Electrotonic Distance
* The notebook titled Electrotonic_Distance.ipynb has information on electrotonic distance



# Stylized Reduced-Order L5 Model
 
 (1)	Synaptic input:

(1.1) deliver a random Poisson distribution of stim to each synapse

(1.2) distribute synapses at random locations on the dendrites

(1.3) random seeding to keep the random set of values consistent between simulations

(1.4) lognormal distribution for synapse conductance

(1.5) nmda/ampa and gaba synapses
